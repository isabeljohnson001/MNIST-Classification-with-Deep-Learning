# MNIST-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for developing and evaluating algorithms in image classification tasks. The MNIST dataset is often used as a starting point for learning and experimenting with image classification algorithms and deep learning models. It provides a relatively simple and well-defined task, making it easier to understand and evaluate the performance of different approaches.

# Objective:

The goal is to train a deep learning model to classify these handwritten digits accurately
